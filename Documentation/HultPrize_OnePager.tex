\section*{Problem}
\justifying
Food waste and hunger coexist because surplus food is hard to discover, verify, and deliver quickly. Local providers lack a trusted, real-time way to share excess food with nearby households.\\[4pt]
\textbf{Evidence:} About one-third (1.3--2.5B tonnes) of food is lost or wasted yearly, around 1B meals/day; this drives 8--10\% of global GHG emissions, with households responsible for ~60\% of waste.

\section*{Solution}
\justifying
NutriLink is a mobile-first platform that enables food providers to list surplus items, beneficiaries to request nearby food, and delivery agents to complete safe, timely distribution.

\section*{Product Snapshot}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Surplus listings with quantity, expiry, and location.
    \item Nearby discovery, requests, and status tracking.
    \item Delivery workflow with pickup and drop-off confirmation.
    \item Notifications and admin impact monitoring.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Target Market}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary users: food providers (restaurants, groceries, institutions), food-insecure households, delivery agents.
    \item Focus geography: Yaounde, with expansion to wider Cameroon.
    \item Market sizing: [TAM/SAM/SOM or estimated addressable households/providers].
\end{itemize}

\section*{Business Model}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provider subscriptions for listing and analytics.
    \item Small delivery/service fees per fulfilled request.
    \item NGO/CSR partnerships and institutional dashboards (future).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Go-to-Market}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pilot with local providers and community partners in Yaounde.
    \item Leverage campus and NGO networks for beneficiary onboarding.
    \item Scale to wider Cameroon after validated unit economics.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Impact Model}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
    \item Metrics tracked: meals delivered, food waste reduced, beneficiaries served.
    \item Impact targets: [e.g., 5,000 meals/month, 20 tons waste reduced/year].
\end{itemize}

\section*{Traction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pilots, partnerships, LOIs, early users, awards.
    \item Prototype or MVP status.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Competitive Advantage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Community-based redistribution with verified roles and accountability.
    \item Real-time listing expiry controls and delivery workflow.
    \item Local partnerships that build trust and scale.
\end{itemize}
